# Simple-Address-Book
Simple Address Book allows users to create, or view contacts (that are once created). Last option is to exit program.

The Simple Address Book C++ program is a fundamental application demonstrating my proficiency in C++ programming. This program allows users to manage a list of contacts, showcasing my skills in object-oriented programming, data structures, and file handling. The user running the program has the option to create a new contact, view contact, or exit the program.
1.Adding Contacts: Users can add new contacts to the address book by providing details such as the contact's name, email address, phone number, and possibly other relevant information like an address or notes.
2.Viewing Contacts: The program allows users to view the list of contacts they have added. Contacts are usually displayed in an organized format, making it easy for users to browse and find specific entries.
3.Exiting the Program.
